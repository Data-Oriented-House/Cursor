To begin, the buffer library allows Luau users to manipulate arrays of bytes with the buffer type. These arrays of bytes are called Buffers. These are the old-school definitions of arrays, allocated with a fixed size that doesn't change after creation. As a user of the buffer library you are provided with useful methods such as buffer.writeu8(buffer, offset, value), which will write into the given buffer an 8 bit unsigned integer with the given value at the given offset or &quot;index.&quot; This api is great at providing low-level access to managing memory formats and sizes, which is crucial for applications requiring optimizing the size of data like networking or data storage. However, the api is not very forgiving when it comes to day-to-day use of packing data whenever you feel like it. "},{"title":"Non Powers Of 2​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installation","url":"/Cursor/docs/intro#non-powers-of-2","content":"To start, if you only need a 3 byte unsigned integer, you have to mentally convert that 3 bytes to 24 bits, then learn there is no buffer.writeu24. You then go &quot;fine&quot; and do both a buffer.writeu8 and buffer.write16 right after, but now have to remember arithmetic bitshifting to write the correct bytes in the correct order. Cool, let's say you did this. Now the code somewhere completely different that needs to read this data needs to do it all over again but in reverse. Not appealing to say the least. "},{"title":"Offsets And Variable Size​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Installation","url":"/Cursor/docs/intro#offsets-and-variable-size","content":"Another cause of concern is needing to manually keep track of offsets if you plan to store multiple values into a buffer. Ok write a u8 at 0. Now write a f64 at 1. Now write an i32 at 2 and you get an access error because that 2 is supposed to be a 9. Ok, sure, you can do arithmetic, but now you need to write a string or other variable-sized data. How do you know how many bytes to offset or how how many bytes to allocate the buffer if you don't know the string? Ok we can first get the length of the string, write that as a u8 at 9, then write the string after. Awesome, out of bounds access error. The string was longer than 255 characters so let's use a u16 to store the length instead. That works, but yet another out of bounds access error. Our buffer is too small and we used all our space. Let's wait until we run out of space and then make a bigger buffer and copy it over. How much bigger? That's a lot going on now. Say we figured it all out, now I need to serialize another data packet and this string is only 3 characters long meaning a u16 is wasting a byte of space. The problems don't seem to stop!

To figure out how many bytes we'd need to represent that non-zero number, we can use ceil(log256(1 + number)). To calculate it: ceil(log256(1 + 7,257,600)) = 3. Our worst case says we need at least 3 bytes to store how long the spaceship has been online. Now that we have 3 bytes, we can quickly calculate the maximum number we can represent to know if this choice will scale well past our expectations. We calculate that using 256^bytes - 1.

Then we want to push how many crew members there are so we know how many crew members to pop off when reading the data. If we can guarantee our spaceships will always have less than 256 crew members, then we can use a 1 byte unsigned integer. However, I think it would be more interesting if we had really big spaceships that could fit potentially thousands of people. That's two bytes, but some ships won't need that many.

Let's start by creating a cursor from a buffer created by spaceshipToBuffer. local function spaceshipFromBuffer(buf: buffer): Spaceship local cursor = Cursor.frombuffer(buf) return { -- todo } end  Now the important thing here is that we pop our data in the opposite order we pushed it. For every push function there is a pop function, so the rest should be self explanatory. let's see the final results: local function spaceshipFromBuffer(buf: buffer): Spaceship local cursor = Cursor.frombuffer(buf) local crewCount = cursor:popvlq() local crew = table.create(crewCount) for i = crewCount, 1, -1 do crew[i] = cursor:popstr() end local name = cursor:popstr() local hullIntegrity = cursor:popf4() local onlineDuration = cursor:popu3() local locked, occupied, underMaintenance = cursor:popbool() return { locked = locked, occupied = occupied, underMaintenance = underMaintenance, onlineDuration = onlineDuration, hullIntegrity = hullIntegrity, name = name, crew = crew, } end  We can now bask in our spaceship serdes implementation! type Spaceship = { locked: boolean, occupied: boolean, underMaintenance: boolean, name: string, crew: { string }, onlineDuration: number, hullIntegrity: number, } local function spaceshipToBuffer(spaceship: Spaceship): buffer local cursor = Cursor.new() :pushbool(spaceship.locked, spaceship.occupied, spaceship.underMaintenance) :pushu3(spaceship.onlineDuration) :pushf4(spaceship.hullIntegrity) :pushstr(spaceship.name) for _, name in spaceship.crew do cursor:pushstr(name) end cursor:pushvlq(#spaceship.crew):print() return cursor:tobuffer() end local function spaceshipFromBuffer(buf: buffer): Spaceship local cursor = Cursor.frombuffer(buf) local crewCount = cursor:popvlq() local crew = table.create(crewCount) for i = crewCount, 1, -1 do crew[i] = cursor:popstr() end local name = cursor:popstr() local hullIntegrity = cursor:popf4() local onlineDuration = cursor:popu3() local locked, occupied, underMaintenance = cursor:popbool() return { locked = locked, occupied = occupied, underMaintenance = underMaintenance, onlineDuration = onlineDuration, hullIntegrity = hullIntegrity, name = name, crew = crew, } end local buf = spaceshipToBuffer { locked = false, occupied = true, underMaintenance = false, onlineDuration = 1677726, hullIntegrity = 0.1, name = &quot;Degasi&quot;, crew = { &quot;Paul Torgal&quot;, &quot;Bart Torgal&quot;, &quot;Marguerit Maida&quot; } } -- Into the byte buffer you go local spaceship = spaceshipFromBuffer(buf) -- Tada!
